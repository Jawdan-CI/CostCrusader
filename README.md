   * While not implemented in the current version, automated testing using a JavaScript testing framework is planned for future enhancements.
   * Unit tests will be written to verify the correctness of individual functions and calculations.
   * End-to-end tests will be implemented to simulate user interactions and ensure the overall flow and functionality of the application.

* **Accessibility Testing (Future Enhancement):** 
   * Accessibility testing using tools like WAVE or Axe will be conducted in future iterations to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities. 
   * This includes checking for proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
